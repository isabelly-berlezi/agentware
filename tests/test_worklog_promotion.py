"""Tests for robust `> LEARNED:` -> promoted-learning recognition
(feature 260625-worklog-promotion-matching-fix).

The promote-before-promise gate (R-SI-03) depends on `worklog scan` reliably
recognizing when a `> LEARNED:` marker has been promoted into a durable learning.
The historical heuristic was a brittle fuzzy SUBSTRING match between the slugified
marker prose and learning filename/id stems. That bit twice:

  * FALSE POSITIVE — a short marker slug (`> LEARNED: ci`) is a substring of an
    unrelated stem (`learn-ci-cache-warming`), so an un-promoted marker was
    silently passed.
  * FALSE NEGATIVE — a genuine promotion whose marker prose does not slug-contain
    the topic is missed, so the loop refuses to finish / re-promotes.

The fix introduces an explicit, deterministic promotion reference
`(Promoted: <id>)` resolved EXACTLY against the live index/files, and tightens the
no-reference fallback from substring containment to exact stem equality.

Invariants re-stated as executable assertions:
  * INV-1 deterministic, stdlib-only — same worklog + same index => byte-identical
    scan output (no LLM/RNG/network/wall-clock).
  * INV-2 read-only — `worklog scan` never mutates the KB; the index is untouched.

Written RED-first against the unmodified `_is_promoted`:
