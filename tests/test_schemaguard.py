"""Central KB-writer registry / schema-guard coverage tests
(feature 260711-emitter-gate-hardening, T3).

Before this feature the older-CLI schema guard covered only index/learn/decide/
ingest — the plan-state writers (cmd_plan_new, cmd_plan_set_status,
cmd_plan_claim — which runs EVERY loop iteration — cmd_plan_set_state,
cmd_plan_state_backfill), cmd_features and the skill writers were UNGUARDED, so
an older CLI could silently mutate a newer (migrated) KB through those verbs.

A single registry (`_kb_writer_funcs`, the version-refusal SUPERSET) now gates
every KB-mutating verb; a separate `_kb_autoapply_funcs` subset (superset minus
the migration-runner verb `cmd_plan_state_backfill`) drives the on-stale-KB
auto-apply so migration 001's backfill never double-runs. `cmd_migrate` and
`cmd_attach` are deliberately NOT registered.

Tests (behavioral, not grep-shaped):
  - COMPLETENESS: walk the argparse set_defaults(func=…) tree and assert the
    registry equals a ground-truth writer set (deliberate-omission canary);
  - per-writer newer-.schema refusal via the real dispatch gate;
  - recall/query stay EXEMPT (not refused);
  - `migrate --list` on an older CLI prints the mismatch honestly and leaves
    `.schema` UNTOUCHED (read-only).

`test_schemaguard_` is unique vs every existing module filename and method.
