"""Done-stamp un-swallow tests (feature 260711-emitter-gate-hardening, T4).

The loop's terminal `running->done` stamp used to be swallowed by `|| true`: a
REFUSED stamp vanished silently. Now the loop WARNs loudly and appends a
`done_stamp_failed` event to metrics.jsonl (through the EXISTING channel), with
NO integer `iteration` field so `derive_iteration_costs` never folds it into a
phantom iteration-0 record. The run STAYS honestly successful.

This drives the REAL `agentware.sh` end-to-end against a SYNTHETIC throwaway KB
(the operator KB is NEVER touched, R-LOC-03) with a FAKE agent runtime that
signals completion (`.loop/.done`) while deliberately leaving ONE task marker
OPEN — so the final `running->done` stamp is REFUSED by the open-markers gate.

Asserts: the loop exits 0 (success); exactly one `done_stamp_failed` event is
appended and it carries NO `iteration`; `derive_iteration_costs` folds no phantom
record; the plan stays `running` (the stamp genuinely did not apply); and
`agentware metrics` still parses the channel.

`test_donestamp_` is unique vs every existing module filename and method.

- ⬜ **1** First synthetic task.

- ⬜ **2** Second synthetic task (left OPEN on purpose).
  *Verify:* trivial echo check passes.
- ⬜ **3** [e2e] End-to-end synthetic check.
  *Verify:* run the synthetic flow end to end and observe success.
- ⬜ **4** [kb] Knowledge-base update.
  *Verify:* scripts/agentware index validate exits 0.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] all synthetic tasks done
