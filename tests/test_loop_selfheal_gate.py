"""Self-healing adversarial-review gate — end-to-end loop test
(feature 260713-adversarial-review-gate, Task 5).

Drives the REAL agentware.sh against a SYNTHETIC, INITIALIZED throwaway knowledge
dir and a FAKE agent runtime, proving the Task-5 wiring in `run_selfheal_review`
(AUDIT -> CALL-OUT -> FIX -> RE-AUDIT, bounded, then PROCEED-or-ESCALATE):

  * a self-extension diff with a planted CONFIRMED defect is CAUGHT, auto-fixed,
    RE-AUDITED clean, and only THEN does the run PROCEED to the done-stamp + kb-sync
    ("fully complete", exit 0);
  * an UNFIXABLE planted defect (the fixer names no regression test, so the fix is
    REFUSED) survives every bounded round -> the run is BLOCKED (exit 1, "BLOCKED"),
    and NEVER reaches the done-stamp / kb-sync ("fully complete" absent);
  * a CLEAN self-extension diff proceeds with no remediation;
  * a NON-self-extension diff skips the gate entirely (byte-identical to today).

The gate spawns its Opus fan-out through `scripts/agentware review`/`remediate`,
which resolve the agent binary via AGENTWARE_CLI — so a single FAKE `claude` binary
drives every reviewer / verifier / critic / fixer with NO real Opus. The operator KB
is never touched (R-LOC-03): HOME + AGENTWARE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR are patched to temp dirs.

> Synthetic plan for the self-healing adversarial-review gate loop test.

## Target packages

- /tmp/aw-selfheal-gate-target

## Tasks

- ⬜ **1** Implement the first synthetic thing deterministically.
  *Verify:* `scripts/agentware index validate` exits 0.

- ⬜ **2** Update the knowledge base after building (`R-KB-*`).
  Run `scripts/agentware learn` then `scripts/agentware index validate`.
  *Verify:* `scripts/agentware index validate` exits 0.

- ⬜ **3** [e2e] Run the end-to-end regression against the real loop.
  *Verify:* `./agentware.sh selfheal-gate` proceeds/blocks as expected.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] the self-heal gate fires on a self-extension diff
